# Amazon-Product-Price-Scraper-and-Prediction-Model

This project consists of two main components:

### 1. Amazon Product Price Scraper Script: A Python script that uses Selenium to scrape product names and prices from the Amazon Egypt video games section and stores them in a CSV file.
### 2. Price Prediction Model in Jupyter Notebook: A machine learning model that predicts product prices based on the scraped data using Random Forest regression, including data analysis, visualization, and price categorization.

## 1. Amazon Product Price Scraper Script
Overview

This Python script automates the process of scraping product names and prices from the Amazon Egypt (EG) website for the video games category. It stores the product data (name and price) in a CSV file (products.csv). The script uses Selenium WebDriver to navigate through the pages, wait for the page content to load, and extract the relevant information.

### Requirements
  1. Python 3.x
  2. Selenium
  3. Pandas
  4. WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome)

### Script Description
  *  The script starts by launching the Chrome WebDriver with headless mode enabled for non-GUI execution.
  *  It loads the URL for the Amazon Egypt video games section and waits for the page elements to be loaded.
  *  It iterates through the product listings on each page, extracting the product names and prices.
  *  The extracted product information is stored in a CSV file (products.csv) as the script scrapes data.
  *  The script handles pagination by identifying the "Next" button and clicking it to go to the next page until all pages have been scraped.

## 2. Price Prediction Model in Jupyter Notebook
Overview

This Jupyter notebook performs data analysis and builds a machine learning model to predict product prices using the scraped data (products.csv). The notebook employs a Random Forest Regressor to predict product prices based on the product names.

### Requirements
  1. Python 3.x
  2. Pandas
  3. Matplotlib
  4. Seaborn
  5. Scikit-learn

### Steps

  1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

  The notebook begins by loading the data from the CSV file.
  It processes the price column to remove commas and converts the values to numeric.
  It handles missing or invalid prices by removing rows with NaN values.

  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  The notebook performs basic statistical analysis (mean, min, max) on the prices.
  It visualizes the distribution of product prices using histograms.
  Filters the data based on a price range for further analysis.

  3. Price Categorization:

  Prices are divided into segments (Low, Medium, High) for better analysis.
  A new column, PriceCategory, is added based on price ranges.

  4. Price Prediction Model:

  The product names are vectorized using TF-IDF to convert them into numerical features.
  A Random Forest Regressor model is trained to predict the product price based on the vectorized product names.
  The model’s performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
  Predictions for new product names are made, showing the predicted prices.
